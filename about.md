From 2013 to 2018 I worked as a professional, self-published author of various works of women's fiction; now I do different work.

This blog in particular is, hopefully, going to contain any resources I write, setting design notes, as well as after-action reports of RPG sessions. It's personal and private, but hopefully, eventually, someone will find something useful here. At least, I hope I will.
