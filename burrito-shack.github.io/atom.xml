   <title>GURPS Reading List and Plans for the Future</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my best friends, certainly my closest gaming confidant, once sagely responded to one of my complaints thusly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fickle, fickle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never denied it. If anything I’ve made an effort to come to him when I’m feeling fickle. Somehow being accused of fickleness, even though I know what I’m doing, keeps me on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, as if to prove myself right, in the course of writing my last post, I got over my frustration with GURPS and straightened my head out. Did the vitamins help? Did the exercise? Did the yogurt? I don’t know. But come yesterday morning I was feeling downright &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;. Better than I have in weeks! Does that mean that I’m happy with my gaming? Not in the least bit. But I feel like it’s fun to think about it again, rather than a chore, and that’s not nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I still have plenty I have to do with my WW2 game. Unless it collapses under the weight of another 2-week hiatus, and then at least another week after that one. And I pretty much have my plans made for that, so I’m stuck waiting for that, because I don’t have the werewithal or energy to run 2 games right now, no matter how much I might like to. I long for the days when I thought I could run 7 concurrent games a week. But I’m not that person any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard, more than once, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GURPS Cabal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; recommended. And I don’t want to say I ignored it, because I didn’t. I filed it away in the back of my mind. But now I’m reading it, because I can, and because I have a slow period at work, and because it promises to be what I’ve always kind-of wanted. And the problem now, as I read it, is where I am going to fit this in, if I’m going to fit it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I’m looking at my projects list, I have &lt;a href=&quot;/almighty-gold/intro/&quot;&gt;Almighty Gold&lt;/a&gt; and another project, as-yet unnamed, which combines my desire for a horror-themed high fantasy and a game about Big Damn Heroes. Something about werewolves, vampires, witches, and the like, having big ol’ Shaw Brothers martial arts fights. I’m tempted to just keep grafting ideas onto that, but I’m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately what I want is a game where I can run what I wish D&amp;amp;D was. Cheap-o, pulpy novels that still make me wonder if I could get a contract with WotC to write for their trash novel line. You go on a big adventure, there are three or four fights, and someone casts some spells, and it’s schlock but I like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we get into where &lt;em&gt;GURPS Cabal&lt;/em&gt; fits in, because it’s got a lot of elements I’m inclined to like. But it’s also got a lot of stuff I’m inclined not to. I don’t want a modern adventure, that’s for sure. I considered, and am still considering, tabling any worldbuilding plans and just using &lt;em&gt;Alchemical Baroque&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know where I’m going with this, so I’m going to stop talking for now. But I’m feeling pretty excited, and if none of it goes anywhere, at least I got to feel excited for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe I can add some silly monster races. That would be nice. A return to Frogman Swamp would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Gaming and the Gentle Art of Overthinking</title>
   <link href="http://burrito-shack.github.io/overthinking/2019/05/05/The-Gentle-Art-of-Overthinking/"/>
   <updated>2019-05-05T15:25:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://burrito-shack.github.io/overthinking/2019/05/05/The-Gentle-Art-of-Overthinking</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Almost as if to make me look like a fool the same day as I wrote a long, vaguely passionate defense of GURPS in &lt;a href=&quot;/gurps/2019/04/29/One-System-to-Rule-Them-All/&quot;&gt;my last blog post&lt;/a&gt;, my play-by-post game, which had been stagnating in the “nobody is talking or making characters” stage that all my games seem to spend a few weeks in broke up, and left me with one player who talked either more than I could handle, or not at all, and then his friend, who only went as far as “not at all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m not proud of myself but I sunk into a depression and ghosted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I’ve been joking in the Mud &amp;amp; Blood Discord that I only play 5e from now on. It’s been a fun joke, and hasn’t required me to do more than some light reading. And I mean very light. Even that wasn’t required. I did think that it might be time to pick up another fun project, which was “how do you build an agrarian medieval fantasy about a world where some people are 20 times stronger than other people, and some people are visibly demons, and you just have to accept that.” But I haven’t done much work on it yet. I might include a few posts on getting that going, if I decide to go that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what I want to talk about. Today I just wanted to talk out my thoughts. Everyone I talk to about it says I’m over-thinking it, and if anything they’re understating the issue. I have always over-thought every single thing. I over-thought tennis, I over-thought my career choices, I over-thought college so much that it took me years to actually attend one. Granted that was more like over-thinking the debt I was going to have to take on to attend, when in fact I may have been under-thinking it. After all, it’s still all there, staring me dead in the eyes, day by day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what I wanted to talk about either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem is that what I want out of a game doesn’t make itself into one coherent idea. I want it all. I want a game that runs fast. I want a game that preps light. I want a game that gives the players all the rules in a pretty little PDF that I can give them, and I want that PDF to be 32 pages long or less including setting information. I want a game that appeals to my sense of aesthetics. I want a game that gives me the excitement of trying something new every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and don’t even get me started on the players. I feel like a cat. I want attention when I want it, and I want to be left alone when I want to be. And I’m just kind of tired of doing such stupid stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, that’s just how it is, and sure, I can get over it. But it’s hard to remind myself, when I have problems, that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; has problems. I’m not uniquely suffering, and I’m barely unique in solving them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve been bothering myself with a long series of problems. I want the player base that 5e represents. I think everyone does. But I don’t like Forgotten Realms, and I don’t like combat slogs, and I feel like that’s kind of what 5e wants from its players. 6-8 “encounters” (which don’t need to be combat, but &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; need to exhaust resources) per Long Rest. I don’t like more than 1 combat per session. And I don’t mind &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; magic, but I don’t like &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt; magic, which is &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;quot;https://talesoftheramblingbumblers.com/2009/01/13/ad-vance-to-a-more-vancian-magic/&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;distinct from Vancian magic&lt;/a&gt; despite what the internet will tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don’t like the settings. I don’t know Forgotten Realms, and I don’t know if I want to learn it. It’s &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; deep, there’s &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much to learn, and at the end of the day when you’re lying in bed you have to ask yourself why nobody else stepped in to save the day. Where was Drizzt? Where was Catti-Brie? Where was Storm Silverhand and the Harpers? Where was Elminster? Where’s Laerel Silverhand? &lt;em&gt;(Ask me how many of these I knew before I looked them up)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a setting with what are functionally Gods running around constantly interfering in events. How precisely did a CR 10 bandit lord entirely escape their attention and fail utterly to elicit a response? How is this plot occurring with a Neutral-Good God running around the North righting every wrong that crosses his path?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So rather than try to learn all 30+ countries, learning one or two of them well enough that I could run them (I will say that my previous attempt involved learning about Cormyr), and hope that &lt;em&gt;eventually I just like it&lt;/em&gt;, that’s obviously out of contention. As are most of the other settings that are “not” Forgotten Realms, because they all fail even more completely to answer basic questions about why, if any old Cleric can make food and water, anyone would bother farming. If they’re not farming, what are they doing? This is a serious issue in the real world. We’re kind of running out of answers to the question “if you’re not making something then what do you actually get paid for,” and we’ve got a lot more ways to make stuff than they did in your typical 13th century society (which, in spite of themselves, the writers of these settings seem to be unable to shake the desire to work around).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s a whole mess. But look. I’m getting too deep into this. The answer seemed pretty obvious. Adventures in Middle Earth is a 5e setting book, it’s a setting I know a little bit about (enough to get by, at least) and it’s got low magic. Technically there’s no Wizard (though the Scholar gets a little close), which is largely consistent with the power set of “Wizards” in Lord of the Rings: Gandalf rarely, if ever, describes himself in such a way. He &lt;em&gt;is Wise&lt;/em&gt;. He knows words of command. But not “spells” that can cast fireballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I think, well, I’ve heard that The One Ring “captures the spirit of Tolkien” better than 5e. So if I’m just going to live in Middle Earth, then I’d rather play the best version of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careful readers will already see the issue at hand here. I’ve already given up the advantage of 5e that I wanted, namely the player base who knows the rules and is excited to play. So what’s the point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the point, indeed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might as well just play GURPS at that point. Play with a few rules tweaks to mimic The One Ring’s on-and-off cycle. And that way I can use a few of the rules supplements that I’ve been interested in exploring from the Games Diner and others. So what’s the big deal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that gets down to what I want here. I just want to get something I can be happy with. So why am I putting all this work into something I don’t know if I care about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as an unrelated question… where’s the line between Dungeon Fantasy and Fantasy? A lot to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think the answer, at least in the short term, is to admit that I don’t need to build my own world, I just need to find something I can be happy with.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>One System to Rule Them All</title>
   <link href="http://burrito-shack.github.io/gurps/2019/04/29/One-System-to-Rule-Them-All/"/>
   <updated>2019-04-29T00:57:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://burrito-shack.github.io/gurps/2019/04/29/One-System-to-Rule-Them-All</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning, I got an email about an &lt;a href=&quot;http://ubiquitousrat.net/?p=5013&quot;&gt;Article from Che Webster&lt;/a&gt; musing about an issue I’ve been wrestling with since I started running games: sticking with one thing. I’m one of the GMs who would start talking about the latest new game he’d heard about, or new idea he’d had, and that pretty much meant that the sign that the current campaign (never long-running) was over. And now I want to tell you how that all changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what? It’s got nothing to do with running a game I’m unhappy with. The same thing happened to me every few weeks, listening to RPG podcasts, even when I didn’t have anything going on. I passed the time at work listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://9littlebees.com/mudandbloodcast/&quot;&gt;Mud and Blood&lt;/a&gt; because they talked about Warhammer, and I was excited about Zweihander. I’m not excited about Zweihander any more, but I listened to a lot of material from them. I got excited about every single game they advertised and I wasn’t running a single thing. I canceled my play-by-post games. For about three months I had nothing going on. And then I started an experimental World War 2 game, hoping it would last me 4 to 10 weeks. That was in January and I’m still working on getting to the end of that one single mission. It’s, uh… gone a little off the rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, also in January, &lt;a href=&quot;/almighty-gold/intro/&quot;&gt;Almighty Gold&lt;/a&gt; was a twinkle in my eye. I had moved to 2nd shift, I was starting to get settled into my new job (by then 4 months old, so I suppose I was only barely settling in; I’m only barely settled in now!) and I was ready to get back to writing, if only a little. Well, I still haven’t, but that’s procrastination for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a project to work on. Something that was &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;. Something I could run games in, and something I could write fiction around. But if I’m going to write a setting, and then run it based on the idea that’s already in my head, I need a game that can be tailored to suit, rather than a system I can tailor a setting around. I can already hear people, barely past the title. “But GURPS isn’t the perfect system,” they might say. Or, perhaps more reasonably, “am I to infer that other systems are, according to you, worse than GURPS?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if there’s one thing that’s important to me, it’s being able to slow down. I don’t want to go on a honeymoon with a game. I want to be able to settle down, even if only for a few months, and really fall into the kind of lasting love that relationships are formed on. You can’t have a happy marriage when you’re chasing every skirt you see. You can’t have a happy gaming life when you’re chasing after the perfect game. The minute you stop searching for something better, and start trying to be happy with what you have, is the minute that you can actually start trying to appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not perfect. I love so many games. I like different ideas. Worse, I’m in several competing RPG scenes. People who love narrative games on one side, people who can’t stand them on the other. A group of players who all natively speak Russian; I know the word “пока.” The first time I talked to someone other than my faithful sounding board about Almighty Gold and got a positive response (“Why not just play the Battletech RPG” was a common response for a while) was like a revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’ve settled in with GURPS. There are rants I could go on. Things I &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;/strong&gt; about GURPS. There’s a lot of material I don’t plan on ever using. I don’t think GURPS is sexy. I don’t get excited reading the Basic Set. I don’t really know anyone who does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don’t get the urge to tell my players that I quit and they’re welcome to join my next campaign with GURPS. Not even when I’m 4 months deep on what was supposed to be a mini-campaign that I never really cared about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if that’s good or bad, but I’m glad I have a relationship now, rather than a fling, and that’s not nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>GURPS Micro-Mecha v0.2</title>
   <link href="http://burrito-shack.github.io/gurps/2019/04/27/GURPS-Micro-Mecha-0.2/"/>
   <updated>2019-04-27T22:20:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://burrito-shack.github.io/gurps/2019/04/27/GURPS-Micro-Mecha-0.2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;patch-notes&quot;&gt;Patch Notes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few changes needed to be made to my previous design, from simple arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the damage was way out of whack. I had reasoned that a shot from a 20-foot-tall robot should essentially always knock out a normal person: 20 damage was a minimum on a hit. But that’s insane, when you scale it. The new damage values reflect the idea that the smallest round a mech of this size would be firing is equivalent, roughly, to a G36 rifle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I added a section on scaling armor to size. However, it’s a little clunky right now. I’m not sure whether I’m going to keep it this way, or try to refactor that rule into something more streamlined and scalable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve considered is adding frame types, particularly a light-and-fast type which has fewer hard points, and a heavy type, with more. But that does cause some difficulty in assigning table values, and eats up a lot of word count when the goal remains a one-page rule set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;micro-mecha&quot;&gt;Micro Mecha&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mecha-at-war&quot;&gt;Mecha At War&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default setting assumed here uses futuristic, laser-firing ‘Mechs of roughly 7 yards in height. For ‘Mechs at different levels of technology, increase Loaded Weight by 1 rank (with the matching decrease in Move) and decrease all other traits by 1 (do not double-tax Move) for every major technological leap backwards, or the opposite (decrease LWt and increase everything else) for the product of improved technology.
For ‘Mechs of lesser size, reduce all ranks including LWt by 1 per major size jump; of greater, increase all ranks including LWt by 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build a mech, you spend 18 Hard Points. Each of these represents a piece of equipment or mechanical feature of your mech. These fall into roughly five categories:
Armor, Movement, Power, Weapons and Support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;armor&quot;&gt;Armor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Hard Point assigned to armor grants 4 dDR, and increases the Tonnage by 1 rank on the table (the default is 20 tons), along with a matching decrease in Move by 1 rank.
When a Mech takes damage, each die of dDamage, or 10 dice of regular damage, dealt at once reduces the overall armor by 1 dDR; Sundering weapons deal 2 dDR worth of damage per die. When scaling according to size, use the maximum Weapon Damage value for 1 hard point at default. &lt;em&gt;For example, if using a Size 4 ranks lower than default, armor grants 6 DR per power point, and is reduced by 1 per regular die of damage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;damage&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When taking damage that penetrates DR, roll a 6-sided die, multiply by a 6-sided die divided by 2 (1 to 3), and compare to the Hard Point list. The Mech makes an HT roll to avoid the system being disabled. If the system is already disabled, then it is destroyed on a failed HT roll. If the system is already destroyed, then roll HT to avoid the entire Mech being blown up. If more than 5 dDamage penetrates DR, continue rolling HT after a failure to see how badly the attack penetrates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;movement&quot;&gt;Movement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Hard Point assigned to additional legs ascends Move by 1 rank, with a default (for two legs) of 10. Regardless of the number of legs, movement costs 1 Power Point.
This requirement may be increased, with each Power Point further increasing Move by 1 rank per point. This must be decided when creating the Mech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;power&quot;&gt;Power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Hardpoint assigned to power generation grants 2 Power Points. These Power Points must be assigned during combat situations to allow movement, fire powerful weapons, and power support equipment.
Assigning and re-assigning Power Points occurs during the combat round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;weapons&quot;&gt;Weapons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Hardpoint assigned to weapons can be grouped together into a single weapon or separated into multiple weapons, depending on preference, though this choice must be made at the time of generation (not in real-time).
Adding a Hardpoint ascends the damage scale by 1 rung, beginning with 1D. Up to 2 modifications can be added per Hard Point, which each add a 1-Power-Point requirement to fire (the default is 0). The modifications are chosen from the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heavy Damage&lt;/strong&gt; ascends 1 rank.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sundering&lt;/strong&gt; Deals extra damage when destroying armor; overall damage is reduced by 1 rank.1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armor Piercing&lt;/strong&gt; Divides dDR by two.1
Multi-Hardpoint weapons systems may take Heavy up to twice per Hard Point, each instance costing 1 Power Point as normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;handheld-weapons&quot;&gt;Handheld Weapons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-Handed Ranged deals Weapon Damage of 1 rank lower, and can take up to 1 Power Point upgrade if limited to 10 shots.
Two-Handed Ranged deals Weapon Damage, and can take up to 1 Power Point upgrade if limited to 10 shots.
Handheld Melee weapons deal Weapon Damage, and automatically choose between being Armor Piercing or Sundering. They then choose 1 further Power Point upgrade, which may be additional Sundering or Armor Piercing, or extra damage. Handheld Melee still cannot have both AP and Sundering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;support&quot;&gt;Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional equipment may be assigned to Hard Points, each of which is listed below, along with any Power Point requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weapons Jammer&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(1 Power)&lt;/em&gt; Attacks made against the Mech are made with a –2 penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting System&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(1 Power)&lt;/em&gt; Attacks made by the Mech are made at +1.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arm&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(1 Power for all Arms)&lt;/em&gt; Either holds handheld weapons, or can be used for striking in melee (Weapon damage +1 Rank).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radar&lt;/strong&gt; Allows an IQ-based Electronics Operation (Sensors)/TL check to locate other nearby Mecha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stealth Countermeasures&lt;/strong&gt; Attempts to use Radar to detect the Mech are made with a –2 penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mecha-combat&quot;&gt;Mecha Combat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each turn, choose one action from those below, and move up to your Move in yards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Gunnery (Mecha)/TL&lt;/em&gt; check to deal  damage to one target per weapons battery. Each target past the first assesses a –1 penalty to all attacks that round.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evade&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Driving (Mecha)/TL&lt;/em&gt; check to give enemy Mechs –2 penalty to attack you for 1 turn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lock-On&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Electronics Operation (Sensors)/TL&lt;/em&gt; to grant a +2 to attacking a specified target on the next turn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Allocation&lt;/strong&gt; Decide whether to act &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;carefully&lt;/em&gt;. Careful allocation takes the full turn. If done quickly, test Repair (Mecha)/TL. On failure, your Power pool shrinks by 1 until you reallocate. On a critical success, your Power pool expands by 1, until combat ends. On a critical failure, your Power pool shrinks by 1 until combat ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Rank&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;LWt&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Move&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;-14&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;200 lbs&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2/3”&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;-13&lt;/td&gt;

   <title>Almighty Gold PbP</title>
   <link href="http://burrito-shack.github.io/gurps/2019/04/27/Almighty-Gold-Ultralite/"/>
   <updated>2019-04-27T20:49:49-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://burrito-shack.github.io/gurps/2019/04/27/Almighty-Gold-Ultralite</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things I took away from the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailanka.blogspot.com/2016/07/a-psi-wars-primer.html&quot;&gt;Psi-Wars articles&lt;/a&gt; by Mailanka, was the importance of actual play-testing in the course of iterating. And of course, I’ve done some iterating on Almighty Gold already. I’ve designed templates. I’ve tested all the various design methods on paper, except for my own. I really ought to get on that, because I did discover that 20 hard points might be way too many, or that weapons may be too powerful, when trying to toy with the idea of 1-foot-tall micro-machines (&lt;a href=&quot;/gurps/2019/04/23/GURPS-Micro-Mecha/&quot;&gt;Micro Mecha&lt;/a&gt; indeed!) with damage in mind (10 hard points put together onto a single huge gun, 4 into armor for DR - which doesn’t scale, and needs to! - and 6 points into legs) was dealing 1D dDamage. Though, to be fair, I did forget that I needed a power plant to move the legs! So I’d be reduced to 3 points of Armor (18 dDR, but it ought to be 30 DR) and with 1 PP to spare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, that’s not really my “ideal” setup. Probably I want, in version 0.2, to drop the damage rank to 5D at base. That way, for a 1-foot tall mini, I’d be looking at 7D, which is about the power of a large-caliber rifle. So I’ll be posting another new Micro-Mecha version tonight, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;for-players&quot;&gt;For Players&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main rules are &lt;a href=&quot;/almighty-gold/ultra-lite/&quot;&gt;GURPS Ultra-Lite&lt;/a&gt;, with the following specifics and additions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three points to spend.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allowed skills are as follows:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Armor-Knight &lt;em&gt;(Begins at Armor-Knight 1 for free)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Infantryman&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Celebrity&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Corporate Spy&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advancement will be pointless. As time passes, you can spend time on training, and in-so-doing can advance in skills, including specializations (not discussed by Ultra-Lite). If you want to specialize, just let me know, and I’ll explain the entire thing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When creating characters, the following information would be appreciated, in addition to your character themselves:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What is the name of their immediate parent-company? What kind of industry does that company belong to? What kind of relationship does your character have with their sponsor?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What is one problem in the city or town your character is immediately responsible for?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Choose one of the following, and give a short description (one or two sentences is sufficient):
        &lt;ol&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Your character is hunted by some person on a vendetta for past wrongs, real or imagined.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Your character has someone who depends on them who must be protected at all costs.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Your character has, or feels they have, a duty to a person or group other than their sponsor and the debt-slaves under their protection.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Your character has sworn a vow in front of witnesses (outside of their agreement with their sponsor). Breaking a publicly sworn vow, in your position, is a very serious crime. Your only connection to your sponsors, after all, is your word. If you can go back on your word in one vow, what’s to stop you breaking another?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During the game, each player has 3 Destiny Points to spend, which replenish at the end of every chapter. You cannot save up more than 3. These can be spent in the following ways:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Turn a failure into success for 1 Destiny Point.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Turn a critical failure into a failure, or success into a critical success, for 2 Destiny Point.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Reduce the damage from any attack to 1 damage for Pilots, or 10 damage for Mecha. Counts as 2D for the purposes of armor reduction, for 1 Destiny Point.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>GURPS Micro-Mecha v0.1</title>
   <link href="http://burrito-shack.github.io/gurps/2019/04/23/GURPS-Micro-Mecha/"/>
   <updated>2019-04-23T23:50:49-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://burrito-shack.github.io/gurps/2019/04/23/GURPS-Micro-Mecha</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s no reason not to admit that I don’t know what I’m doing, since it’s on a private blog! Even still, I don’t know what I’m doing. That’s important to establish off the bat. But let’s get on to the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;gurps-mecha-is-a-mess&quot;&gt;GURPS Mecha Is A Mess&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not being very fair, am I? After all, David Pulver worked hard on &lt;em&gt;GURPS Mecha&lt;/em&gt;! Or did he work hard on &lt;em&gt;GURPS Spaceships&lt;/em&gt;? Or did he work hard on &lt;em&gt;GURPS Spaceships 4: Fighters, Carriers and Mecha&lt;/em&gt;? Or did Sean Punch work hard on the &lt;em&gt;Fourth Edition Basic Set&lt;/em&gt;, and I should build a Mech as a character on a 1000 point budget, giving his main cannons as Innate Attacks and scaling up handheld weapon damage somehow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the answer is “Yes,” and “All of the above.” Of course Pulver worked hard. Of course the &lt;em&gt;Basic Set&lt;/em&gt; is good. And there’s a good argument in favor of doing it both ways. But there are five separate systems for designing Mecha in GURPS, between 3rd and 4th editions. And all of them are complicated. Even &lt;em&gt;GURPS Spaceships&lt;/em&gt; is complicated, to a degree. It takes 28 pages to explain the systems on offer. &lt;em&gt;GURPS Spaceships 4&lt;/em&gt; has an explanation of Mecha which is drastically undercut, with only SM+4 designs and legs added, but the removal of Medium/Minor weapons for those designs, and no explanation of how to scale handheld weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in this mixture of 6 separate systems (Mecha as Allies, 3e &lt;em&gt;GURPS Mecha&lt;/em&gt;, 3e &lt;em&gt;GURPS Vehicles 2nd Edition&lt;/em&gt;, 4e &lt;em&gt;GURPS Spaceships 4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pyramid #3/40&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;em&gt;Mecha Operations&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pyramid #3/51&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;em&gt;Modular Mecha&lt;/em&gt;), and with the hopes of running an Ultra-Lite Mecha game via Play-by-Post, I came up with a way to make things worse: I made another one, and I made my best effort to fit it onto a single page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;micro-mecha&quot;&gt;Micro Mecha&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mecha-at-war&quot;&gt;Mecha At War&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default setting assumed here uses futuristic, laser-firing ‘Mechs of roughly 7 yards in height. For ‘Mechs at different levels of technology, increase Loaded Weight by 1 rank (with the matching decrease in Move) and decrease all other traits by 1 (do not double-tax Move) for every major technological leap backwards, or the opposite (decrease LWt and increase everything else) for the product of improved technology.
For ‘Mechs of lesser size, reduce all ranks including LWt by 1 per major size jump; of greater, increase all ranks including LWt by 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build a mech, you spend 20 Hard Points. Each of these represents a piece of equipment or mechanical feature of your mech. These fall into roughly five categories:
Armor, Movement, Power, Weapons and Support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;armor&quot;&gt;Armor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Hard Point assigned to armor grants 6 dDR, and increases the Tonnage by 1 rank on the table (the default is 20 tons), along with a matching decrease in Move by 1 rank.
When a Mech takes damage, each die of dDamage dealt reduces the overall armor by 1 dDR; Sundering weapons deal 2 dDR worth of damage per die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;damage&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When taking damage that penetrates DR, roll a 20-sided die and compare to the Hard Point list. The Mech makes an HT roll to avoid the system being disabled. If the system is already disabled, then it is destroyed on a failed HT roll. If the system is already destroyed, then roll HT to avoid the entire Mech being blown up. If more than 5 dDamage penetrates DR, continue rolling HT after a failure to see how badly the attack penetrates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;movement&quot;&gt;Movement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Hard Point assigned to additional legs ascends Move by 1 rank, with a default (for two legs) of 10. Regardless of the number of legs, movement costs 1 Power Point.
This requirement may be increased, with each Power Point further increasing Move by 1 rank per point. This must be decided when creating the Mech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;power&quot;&gt;Power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Hardpoint assigned to power generation grants 2 Power Points. These Power Points must be assigned during combat situations to allow movement, fire powerful weapons, and power support equipment.
Assigning and re-assigning Power Points occurs during the combat round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;weapons&quot;&gt;Weapons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Hardpoint assigned to weapons can be grouped together into a single weapon or separated into multiple weapons, depending on preference, though this choice must be made at the time of generation (not in real-time).
Adding a Hardpoint ascends the damage scale by 1 rung, beginning with 1D. Up to 2 modifications can be added per Hard Point, which each add a 1-Power-Point requirement to fire (the default is 0). The modifications are chosen from the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heavy Damage&lt;/strong&gt; ascends 1 rank.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sundering&lt;/strong&gt; Deals extra damage when destroying armor; overall damage is reduced by 1 rank.1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armor Piercing&lt;/strong&gt; Divides dDR by two.1
Multi-Hardpoint weapons systems may take Heavy up to twice per Hard Point, each instance costing 1 Power Point as normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;handheld-weapons&quot;&gt;Handheld Weapons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-Handed Ranged deals Weapon Damage of 1 rank lower, and can take up to 1 Power Point upgrade if limited to 10 shots.
Two-Handed Ranged deals Weapon Damage, and can take up to 1 Power Point upgrade if limited to 10 shots.
Handheld Melee weapons deal Weapon Damage, and automatically choose between being Armor Piercing or Sundering. They then choose 1 further Power Point upgrade, which may be additional Sundering or Armor Piercing, or extra damage. Handheld Melee still cannot have both AP and Sundering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;support&quot;&gt;Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional equipment may be assigned to Hard Points, each of which is listed below, along with any Power Point requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weapons Jammer&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(1 Power)&lt;/em&gt; Attacks made against the Mech are made with a –2 penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting System&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(1 Power)&lt;/em&gt; Attacks made by the Mech are made at +1.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arm&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(1 Power for all Arms)&lt;/em&gt; Either holds handheld weapons, or can be used for striking in melee (Weapon damage +1 Rank).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radar&lt;/strong&gt; Allows an IQ-based Electronics Operation (Sensors)/TL check to locate other nearby Mecha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stealth Countermeasures&lt;/strong&gt; Attempts to use Radar to detect the Mech are made with a –2 penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mecha-combat&quot;&gt;Mecha Combat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each turn, choose one action from those below, and move up to your Move in yards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Gunnery (Mecha)/TL&lt;/em&gt; check to deal  damage to one target per weapons battery. Each target past the first assesses a –1 penalty to all attacks that round.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evade&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Driving (Mecha)/TL&lt;/em&gt; check to give enemy Mechs –2 penalty to attack you for 1 turn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lock-On&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Electronics Operation (Sensors)/TL&lt;/em&gt; to grant a +2 to attacking a specified target on the next turn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Allocation&lt;/strong&gt; Decide whether to act &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;carefully&lt;/em&gt;. Careful allocation takes the full turn. If done quickly, test Repair (Mecha)/TL. On failure, your Power pool shrinks by 1 until you reallocate. On a critical success, your Power pool expands by 1, until combat ends. On a critical failure, your Power pool shrinks by 1 until combat ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Rank&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;LWt&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Move&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
