  <article>
    <p>This morning, I got an email about an <a href="http://ubiquitousrat.net/?p=5013">Article from Che Webster</a> musing about an issue I’ve been wrestling with since I started running games: sticking with one thing. I’m one of the GMs who would start talking about the latest new game he’d heard about, or new idea he’d had, and that pretty much meant that the sign that the current campaign (never long-running) was over. And now I want to tell you how that all changed.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>You know what? It’s got nothing to do with running a game I’m unhappy with. The same thing happened to me every few weeks, listening to RPG podcasts, even when I didn’t have anything going on. I passed the time at work listening to <a href="https://9littlebees.com/mudandbloodcast/">Mud and Blood</a> because they talked about Warhammer, and I was excited about Zweihander. I’m not excited about Zweihander any more, but I listened to a lot of material from them. I got excited about every single game they advertised and I wasn’t running a single thing. I canceled my play-by-post games. For about three months I had nothing going on. And then I started an experimental World War 2 game, hoping it would last me 4 to 10 weeks. That was in January and I’m still working on getting to the end of that one single mission. It’s, uh… gone a little off the rails.</p>

<p>Well, also in January, <a href="/almighty-gold/intro/">Almighty Gold</a> was a twinkle in my eye. I had moved to 2nd shift, I was starting to get settled into my new job (by then 4 months old, so I suppose I was only barely settling in; I’m only barely settled in now!) and I was ready to get back to writing, if only a little. Well, I still haven’t, but that’s procrastination for you!</p>

<p>I wanted a project to work on. Something that was <em>mine</em>. Something I could run games in, and something I could write fiction around. But if I’m going to write a setting, and then run it based on the idea that’s already in my head, I need a game that can be tailored to suit, rather than a system I can tailor a setting around. I can already hear people, barely past the title. “But GURPS isn’t the perfect system,” they might say. Or, perhaps more reasonably, “am I to infer that other systems are, according to you, worse than GURPS?”</p>

<p><strong>No.</strong></p>

<p>But if there’s one thing that’s important to me, it’s being able to slow down. I don’t want to go on a honeymoon with a game. I want to be able to settle down, even if only for a few months, and really fall into the kind of lasting love that relationships are formed on. You can’t have a happy marriage when you’re chasing every skirt you see. You can’t have a happy gaming life when you’re chasing after the perfect game. The minute you stop searching for something better, and start trying to be happy with what you have, is the minute that you can actually start trying to appreciate it.</p>

<p>I’m not perfect. I love so many games. I like different ideas. Worse, I’m in several competing RPG scenes. People who love narrative games on one side, people who can’t stand them on the other. A group of players who all natively speak Russian; I know the word “пока.” The first time I talked to someone other than my faithful sounding board about Almighty Gold and got a positive response (“Why not just play the Battletech RPG” was a common response for a while) was like a revelation.</p>

<p>But I’ve settled in with GURPS. There are rants I could go on. Things I <strong>hate</strong> about GURPS. There’s a lot of material I don’t plan on ever using. I don’t think GURPS is sexy. I don’t get excited reading the Basic Set. I don’t really know anyone who does.</p>

<p>But I don’t get the urge to tell my players that I quit and they’re welcome to join my next campaign with GURPS. Not even when I’m 4 months deep on what was supposed to be a mini-campaign that I never really cared about.</p>

<p>I don’t know if that’s good or bad, but I’m glad I have a relationship now, rather than a fling, and that’s not nothing.</p>
