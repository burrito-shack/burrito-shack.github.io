The text is formatted as a "Pocket-Mod", which is excellent as a carryable printed form-factor. As a digital product, however, it leaves a lot to be desired. Here is the full text, human-readable and screen-scalable.

# GURPS Ultra-Lite
(Fourth Edition, Version 0.8)

This game assumes you know what "RPG," "PC," "GM," "3d6," and "NPC" mean. Learning it will teach you some ***GURPS*** concepts, but not all — ***GURPS*** is *much* larger!

### Levels
To build a PC, allocate ***levels*** to capabilities. Most heroes have 3-5 levels, but the GM can pick another number. Capabilities include **Strength (ST), Dexterity (DX), Intelligance (IQ),** and **Health (HT).** You start at Normal, can add levels to each, and can *gain* one extra level somewhere else by going below Normal in one category.

- ***ST:*** Sets ***Hit Points (HP)*** and ***Basic Damage.*** Levels are Weak (8 HP, 1d6/2), Normal (10 HP, 1d6), Strong (14 HP, 2d6), and Very Strong (18HP, 3d6).
- ***DX:*** Gives your ***base roll*** whenever precision or reflexes dominate: attacking, driving, etc. Levels and base rolls: Clumsy (8), Normal (10), Agile (12), Very Agile (14), and Extreme (16).
- ***IQ:*** Gives your base roll when brains matter (code-breaking, science, etc.): Dull (8), Normal (10), Smart (12), Very Smart (14), and Genius (16).
- ***HT:*** Gives your base roll to resist poison, unconsciousness, and death: Sickly (8), Normal (10), Hardy (14), and Very Hardy (18).

### Tasks and Skills
To perform a task or resist something, roll 3d6. On a result no greater than your base roll, you succeed; otherwise, you fail. Apply —6 to base rolls for tasks that require training: attacking, code-breaking, driving, etc.

The GM can vary difficulty by assigning a modifier from —10 (hard to do/resist) to +10 (easy!); e.g., Very Hardy (18) resists "poison -5" at 13.

To be better at tasks, you can put some of your levels into ***skills***. Skills go with professions the GM allows on this adventure — Crook, Knight, Ninja, etc. Each skill has four levels. Each level gives +4 for its tasks. Note level *and* bonus; e.g., Crook 2 (+8).

*Example: Neutralizing an alarm is a Crook task that takes brains (IQ). Two levels in IQ Very Smart (14) makes the roll 14-6 = 8. A criminal with IQ Normal (10) and those two levels in Crook 2 (+8) rolls 10-6+8 = 12.*

A 3 on the dice *always* succeeds and an 18 *always* fails!

### Reactions
The GM designates NPCs as *hostile* (fights/uses abilities against PCs), *undecided* or *friendly* (fights/uses abilities for PCs). For an undecided NPC, the GM rolls 3d6 for a ***reaction:*** 3-6 means he turns hostile, 7-14 means he won't get involved, and 15-18 means he helps. Heroes can put one level in ***Charismatic,*** a capability that turns hostile reactions neutral and neutral ones helpful.

### Gear
Skills include relevant gear. Levels in combat skills (like Knight) give superior gear that improves weapon damage and armor. Heroes can always put one level in ***Wealthy,*** a capability that adds two levels to combat skills for the sole purpose of weapon damage and armor.

### Combat
Combat proceeds in ***turns.*** Each turn, each fighter picks one option (and one foe, if he attacks):

* ***Melee attack:*** A trained task using DX and a skill like Karate Master (if unarmed) or Knight (if armed). The skill must fit the weapon (e.g., Samurai for katana) to count when armed. Subtract *half* your enemy's combat skill bonus; e.g., with Agile (12) and Samurai 2 (+8), you need 12-6+8 = 14 to hit, or 10 if your foe has Ninja 2 (+8).

  > Success when unarmed does damage equal to *half* your Basic Damage roll (drop fractions); Weak heroes inflict 1 point. Use the *full* roll when armed. Add combat skill level (not bonus) to damage; e.g., Knight 2 (+8) gives +2.

* ***Ranged attack:*** As above, but skills are things like Ninja for shuriken or Infantryman for rifles. *Don't* subtract half your enemy's bonus. The GM may give up to -10 for range. Success does Basic Damage for bows and thrown weapons, 2d for pistols, or 5d for rifles. Skill level still adds to damage.
* ***Move:*** Run from ranged to melee or melee to ranged.
* ***Defend:*** Duck! Subtract your *full* skill bonus from enemy melee attacks, *half* that from ranged ones.

Armor protects the wearer against damage. Subtract 1 from enemy damage rolls per level in a skill that uses light, low-tech armor (e.g. Swashbuckler), 2 per level in one that uses heavy low-tech armor (e.g., Knight) or light high-tech armor (e.g., Cop), or 4 per level in one that uses heavy high-tech armor (e.g,, Commando). Whatever is left comes off HP.

At 0 HP, roll base HT each turn before acting; failure means you pass out. At —HP, you collapse; roll base HT or die. If you survive, make a daily HT roll to recover 1 HP.
