# Your Place in the World

*Governments are gone, and corporations have taken their place. Their three-sided war has chilled to mud-slinging and posturing. Historians see the ancient days of traditional government  through rose-colored glasses and the ruins of a space-faring world. Only now has society realized re-industrialization. Far below the corporate leadership are the debt slaves, without hope in the world. In between, a dense web of child-companies employ nobled houses on oral contracts, as peace-keepers and figureheads. The most honored and sought-after of these families have inherited technology of the old days. Armor, two-story tall weapons of war. Only specialists can repair Armor, and only with great difficulty. For all their power, corporations cannot make any but pale imitations. You are an Armor-knight. You are the bulwark that protects your people, and you are the boot on their throat. They need you to protect them; you need your corporate masters to continue allowing it...*

## The World Around You

### The Mega-Corporations

**Marsoleil**
: Oldest of the major corporations; currently the only corp to produce full-scale Armor of their own, though it pales in comparison to what was being made long ago, before the decline. Outside of military applications, they are a leader in transportation of all sorts.

**Vengeresse**
: Small-Arms and Electronic focus, and the youngest of the 3 corporations. Though Marsoleil has the best records of the Golden Age, Vengeresse leadership believes that their overreliance on Golden-Age technology has prevented them from learning new lessons and treading new ground.

**Canular√©seau**
: Communications giant. Currently the most advanced communications technology, the only Corp capable of long-distance (continent-spanning) technology. They lease the technology, on a subscription basis, to other Corporations, but listen in on all communications going over their wires. (Other Corporations use traditional radio.)
