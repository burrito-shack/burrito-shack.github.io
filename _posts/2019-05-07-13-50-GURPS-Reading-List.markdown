One of my best friends, certainly my closest gaming confidant, once sagely responded to one of my complaints thusly:

> Fickle, fickle.

I never denied it. If anything I've made an effort to come to him when I'm feeling fickle. Somehow being accused of fickleness, even though I know what I'm doing, keeps me on track.

Well, as if to prove myself right, in the course of writing my last post, I got over my frustration with GURPS and straightened my head out. Did the vitamins help? Did the exercise? Did the yogurt? I don't know. But come yesterday morning I was feeling downright *better*. Better than I have in weeks! Does that mean that I'm happy with my gaming? Not in the least bit. But I feel like it's fun to think about it again, rather than a chore, and that's not nothing.

<!-- more -->

So I still have plenty I have to do with my WW2 game. Unless it collapses under the weight of another 2-week hiatus, and then at least another week after that one. And I pretty much have my plans made for that, so I'm stuck waiting for that, because I don't have the werewithal or energy to run 2 games right now, no matter how much I might like to. I long for the days when I thought I could run 7 concurrent games a week. But I'm not that person any more.

I have heard, more than once, ***GURPS Cabal*** recommended. And I don't want to say I ignored it, because I didn't. I filed it away in the back of my mind. But now I'm reading it, because I can, and because I have a slow period at work, and because it promises to be what I've always kind-of wanted. And the problem now, as I read it, is where I am going to fit this in, if I'm going to fit it in.

If I'm looking at my projects list, I have [Almighty Gold]({% link almighty-gold/intro.md %}) and another project, as-yet unnamed, which combines my desire for a horror-themed high fantasy and a game about Big Damn Heroes. Something about werewolves, vampires, witches, and the like, having big ol' Shaw Brothers martial arts fights. I'm tempted to just keep grafting ideas onto that, but I'm not sure.

Ultimately what I want is a game where I can run what I wish D&D was. Cheap-o, pulpy novels that still make me wonder if I could get a contract with WotC to write for their trash novel line. You go on a big adventure, there are three or four fights, and someone casts some spells, and it's schlock but I like it.

Now we get into where *GURPS Cabal* fits in, because it's got a lot of elements I'm inclined to like. But it's also got a lot of stuff I'm inclined not to. I don't want a modern adventure, that's for sure. I considered, and am still considering, tabling any worldbuilding plans and just using *Alchemical Baroque*.

I don't know where I'm going with this, so I'm going to stop talking for now. But I'm feeling pretty excited, and if none of it goes anywhere, at least I got to feel excited for a minute.

And maybe I can add some silly monster races. That would be nice. A return to Frogman Swamp would be nice.
